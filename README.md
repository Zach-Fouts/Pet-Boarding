Pet Boarding Employee Portal

### Overview
We are building the software for a pet boarding business, focusing on internal needs. The core of this software is the management of pet reservations. The date and length of the stay, pet and owner information, employee and user information, and more will be kept in a database to be used in managing the business. Detailed search functions will allow users access to necessary information. Our project will utilize a login system with role based access to enable Admins to manage employees and users, while only allowing employees to access pet and reservation information. Employees are able to add information to pets and reservations about the stay or additional information for the pet, process payments, and create invoices. We also allow the deactivation of certain models in the interest of record keeping before deletion is possible.

- Calendar/ Reservation System: Users will be able to make reservations for a pet, filling in the length of the stay, the petâ€™s name and breed, and any other information necessary for the business.
