## Submission Instructions

### Overview
We are building the software for a pet boarding business, focusing on the internal needs of the business. The core of this software is the management of the pet reservations. The date and length of the stay, the pet and owner information, employee information, and more will be kept in a database to be used in managing the business. Detailed search functions will allow users to pull up the information they need to do their job whether that is a business wide view or the details of a singular pet. Our project will utilize a login system with different levels of access to enable an Admin to manage employees and pet reservations, while only allowing employees to access pet and reservation information. Employees are able to add information to pets and reservations about how the stay is going or additional information for the pet. 

### Features
- Calendar/ Reservation System: Users will be able to make reservations for a pet, filling in the length of the stay, the petâ€™s name and breed, and any other information necessary for the business.

- Reservation Search Feature: The built in search feature will allow users to find needed information and filter by date, breed, service, owner, etc.

- User Management/CRUD: Users can login to see their work tasks. Account levels will allow admins to view information not given to employee level logins.

- Pet CRUD: Pets can be registered, searched, updated and deactivated. This feature will allow for the creation of reservations.
    
- Owner CRUD: Pet owners can be entered into the system and their saved information can be updated as necessary. 

### Technologies
Backend - Java, Spring Boot, MySQL, Hibernate
Front End - Thymeleaf, payment and calendar API to be determined

### What I'll Have to Learn
While the core technologies are ones that have been used in class there are still things to learn in the use whether that is new functions within them or mastery of what has been seen before. Something that will be completely new to us is the API usage. We are choosing to integrate calendar and payment service API's to focus on other areas of the project. We will have to learn to use whichever API's we choose but even the usage of an API is a new skill we will have to develop. From a non-technology standpoint our group will have to learn to work together for this project. We've worked in groups all of our lives but each group is new and this specific process of building a coding project is new to all of us.
